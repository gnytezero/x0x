//! Relay fan-out policy — #674 C2/C3 (fleet CPU, inbound/relay side).
//!
//! ~99% of a bootstrap's gossip send-path work is *relayed* traffic:
//! inbound messages on topics the node has no local subscriber for, which
//! saorsa-gossip eager-republishes to the full eager set (measured 242
//! sends/s, 4.27 MB/s per node). sg 0.5.79 adds
//! [`ValidationAction::LazyForward`] — withhold the eager re-publish, keep
//! the message cached and IWANT-serveable, and announce the msg_id via
//! IHAVE (to the lazy set AND every peer whose eager send was withheld) —
//! so delivery is preserved at ~1 IHAVE instead of an EAGER per withheld
//! peer, at the cost of one 100 ms flush + RTT of extra latency.
//!
//! This module owns the x0x side of that verdict, as one composite
//! per-topic validator:
//!
//! 1. **Base (content) validators first** — the storm-control classifiers
//!    (`crate::storm_control`). Their `Drop`/`DeliverOnly` verdicts always
//!    win: fan-out policy must never *widen* suppression, and a
//!    `LazyForward` would reintroduce an IHAVE announce for a message
//!    storm control refused to forward.
//! 2. **C2 — lazy-only for unconsumed topics.** A topic with zero local
//!    subscribers is never delivered locally anyway; the node's only role
//!    is relay, and lazy relay is strictly cheaper on the send path. The
//!    verdict is `LazyForward` unconditionally (the C3 budget does not buy
//!    eager sends back for topics nobody here consumes). Live subscriber
//!    state is read from the same `subscribed_topic_ids` set the Leaf C0
//!    refuse gate uses, so the last unsubscribe / first subscribe flips
//!    the mode without touching sg validator registration.
//! 3. **C3 — per-topic eager budget for consumed topics.** Topics WITH
//!    local subscribers keep today's eager forwarding inside a token
//!    bucket (messages/s); when the budget is exhausted the topic
//!    degrades to `LazyForward` and recovers as the bucket refills. A
//!    budget of 0 disables the gate (always eager), matching the
//!    `leaf_egress_*_bytes_per_sec` "0 disables" convention.
//!
//! Bootstraps keep `Full` participation, so the relay role and ADR-0034
//! hold; this changes *how* relays forward (lazy first), not *whether*.
